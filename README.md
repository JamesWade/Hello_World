Project
Hello World I am James, a fourteen year old boy, and I am interested in learning stuff about computers. I AM NOT A SCRPIT KIDDIE. I am trying to learn how to program and how to hack (not the bad hacking that the news makes the public beleive)the right way. 
I wrote this because I wanted you to know a bit about me.
